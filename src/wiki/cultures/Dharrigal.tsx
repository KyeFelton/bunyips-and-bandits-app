    The Dharrigal are various indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands lie
    within the region of Downunda. They encompass a diverse array of cultures
    and languages that are united through shared history, spiritual beliefs, and
    customary practices. They are ethnically distinct from the Underroot and
    Drop Bear peoples of Downunda.

    <H2>Demographics</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Dharrigal society is made up of several peoples, including humans,
        birim, karrakans, wattalangs and yowies. Though these peoples maintain
        their own customs and dialects, intercommunity bonds are strong,
        reinforced through shared festivals, trade, and spiritual rites.
        Kinship networks often cross species lines, and it is not uncommon to
        find multi-species mobs living cooperatively within a single Country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Populations tend to be semi-nomadic or village-based, with seasonal
        migrations following traditional songlines and ecological patterns.
        Dharrigal society does not adhere to rigid class systems; instead,
        status is often earned through age, wisdom, or spiritual
        responsibility.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H2>Languages</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Dharrigal people speak a wide range of languages and dialects,
        reflecting their diverse cultures and connection to Country. Most
        Dharrigal are bilingual, speaking both a language native to their
        community and the Dharrigal bridge language, essential for passing on
        songlines, law, and spiritual knowledge across community boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the Invasion, many community languages have become endangered or
        extinct. Some communities now speak a mix of traditional language and
        Englorian, with Englorian fluency often higher near Englorian
        settlements. Despite this, efforts to preserve native tongues continue,
        especially through elders, who pass on language through story, song,
        and ritual.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H2>History</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        For countless generations, Downunda was divided among numerous small
        nations, each with its own customs, languages, and laws. Despite their
        diversity, these nations shared a common spiritual worldview, grounded
        in deep respect for the land. The societies were largely peaceful, with
        occasional conflicts, notably with Drop Bear clans. These nations were
        eventually dismantled following the Englorian Invasion.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H3>The Englorian Invasion</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Tensions between the expanding Englorian Empire and the Dharrigal
        nations arose swiftly. Conflicts were driven by cultural
        misunderstandings, resource disputes, and systemic exploitation by the
        Englorians. These tensions escalated into trade sanctions, looting,
        guerrilla warfare, and, in severe cases, the complete genocide of
        communities. Though casualties occurred on both sides, the superior
        numbers and organisation of the Englorian forces led to the widespread
        subjugation of the Dharrigal. The reigning Empress formally declared
        all Dharrigal lands as part of the Empire. Nevertheless, many Dharrigal
        communities endured—some remaining in isolated enclaves, others
        absorbed into Englorian society or displaced to far-off lands.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H2>Legends</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Dharrigal oral traditions preserve numerous stories and legends that
        explain the creation of the world and the origins of their people.
        These narratives serve as both spiritual guidance and practical wisdom,
        passed down through generations by elders.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H3>Rainbow Serpent</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        The Rainbow Serpent, referred to by different names in different mobs,
        is a revered ancestral being across all Dharrigal cultures. She is
        considered the progenitor of the Dharrigal and the creator of the land.
        Both life-giving and potentially destructive if angered, she is a
        central figure in spiritual lore.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to legend, the Rainbow Serpent was disturbed from a long
        slumber by a storm that flooded her burrow. She slithered across the
        land looking for a new burrow, creating mountains and rivers in her
        wake. Only once she found a place to settle, she created the first
        animals to inhabit the land that she had formed. She then gave wisdom
        and intelligence to the most well behaved animals so that they could
        nurture and protect the land whilst she slumbered. Finally, she made a
        new burrow and went back to her hibernation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dharrigal people also believe that the Rainbow Serpent was the
        cause of the Great Storm that ended the Englorian Invasion. She created
        the calamity as retribution for the destruction that the Englorian
        Empire had caused to the lands, waters and peoples.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H3>The Sun and Moon</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        It is believed that there was an age when the world was in darkness and
        all living beings carried their own torches to see and travel. During
        this time there was a man and woman who had their first child.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, the woman went foraging for food and asked the man to watch
        over their child. At first the man did as was told, but overtime grew
        weary and fell asleep. When he awoke, the child was gone. Little did he
        know, the child had been eaten by a crocodile. When the mother
        returned, she was overcome with grief and rage. With her torch in hand,
        she raced across the sky to search for her lost child but he could not
        be found.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day she continues her search, travelling across the sky and
        bringing light to the world as the sun. When she reaches the end of her
        journey, she descends to rest, creating night, before continuing the
        next day. The man also wanders the sky as the moon. His face changes as
        his shame waxes and wanes—when he is full, he is seen clearly, burdened
        by guilt; when he fades, he hides from the sun's gaze.

    <H2>Traditions and Beliefs</H2>

    <H3>Country and Spirituality</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        "Country" refers to the land, seas, and waterways to which Dharrigal
        people are spiritually and culturally connected. The term encompasses a
        complex web of meaning involving law, language, kinship, identity,
        spirituality, and sustenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dharrigal belief holds that the spirits of their ancestors dwell within
        the landscape, particularly in trees and animals. A "Welcome to
        Country" ceremony, performed by local elders, involves invoking these
        spirits to permit safe passage to guests as a gesture of trust. Elders
        serve as mediators and arbiters, interpreting the will of the spirits
        to resolve disputes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mob is a term to identify a group of Dharrigal people of a particular
        place or Country.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H3>Songlines</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        The preservation of Dharrigal knowledge relies on oral traditions, with
        elders acting as custodians of history, law, and spiritual wisdom.
        Stories are not just entertainment but encoded instructions for living
        in harmony with Country. These narratives often contain moral lessons,
        practical survival strategies, and warnings about the consequences of
        greed or disrespect.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H3>Funerals and Sorry Business</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Dharrigal funeral practices are diverse, often involving body painting
        with ochre, smoking ceremonies and ceremonial dances. The deceased body
        may be buried in the ground as is, wrapped in bark or tombed inside a
        tree hollow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry Business is a significant period where communities mourn, and
        family members have specific kinship-based responsibilities to
        participate in ceremonies. During this time, cultural restrictions may
        be observed, such as avoiding the use of the deceased's name and
        refraining from certain events.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H3>Sacred Spaces</H3>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Certain areas of Country are designated as sacred, off-limits to all
        but the most revered elders and spiritual leaders. These sites, often
        marked by unusual geological formations or ancient carvings, are
        believed to be the physical manifestations of the Rainbow Serpent's
        presence. Taboos govern behaviour in these spaces, prohibiting
        activities such as hunting, gathering or speaking aloud. Violations are
        considered grave offences, as they are seen as disrupting the delicate
        balance between the physical and spiritual realms.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H2>Architecture</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Dharrigal architecture is utilitarian. Shelters are designed to serve
        practical purposes, rather than to symbolize status, power, or wealth.
        There is little emphasis on permanent structures or monuments.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H2>Clothing</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Traditional Dharrigal clothing is simple, often limited to loincloths
        or modest garments. Jewellery is not traditionally worn, though during
        festivals and ceremonies, body painting with symbolic designs is
        common.
      </p>
    </Body>

    <H2>Agriculture and Domestication</H2>
    <Body>
      <p>
        Dharrigal subsistence practices are based on sustainable management of
        the land and seasonal resource use. Communities cultivate and harvest a
        range of native plants, including yams, tubers, and grains derived from
        grass and acacia seeds. Fruits such as bush apples, quandongs, figs,
        and lilly pillies are commonly foraged. Firestick farming, involving
        small, controlled burns, is used to promote the growth of desirable
        plant species and prevent large bushfires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hunting and fishing supplement plant-based food sources. Fishing
        practices include the use of spears, nets, and traps to catch fish,
        rays, and eels, while constructed weirs and trenches manage water
        resources for irrigation and fish capture. Kangaroos, emus, wolloks,
        and smaller marsupials are hunted according to seasonal and spiritual
        laws that prevent overexploitation. Certain animals are protected or
        restricted from hunting at specific times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domesticated animals play a meaningful role in Dharrigal society,
        varying between regions according to environmental conditions and
        cultural practices. Dingos are the most widespread companion animals,
        raised from pups and trained to assist in hunting by tracking and
        flushing out prey. They also serve as protectors, alerting communities
        to intruders or predators. Emus are maintained in some regions for
        their eggs, which are reserved for ceremonial use or as food for
        elders. Their feathers are occasionally used in decoration, and smaller
        folk may ride them for short travel. In forested areas, honeyeaters are
        trained to locate wild honey ant nests and stingless bee hives. The
        birds are rewarded with scraps of wax and insects after harvest.
