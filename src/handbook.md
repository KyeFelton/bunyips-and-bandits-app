# Handbook

G’day, adventurer! Welcome to Bunyips and Bandits, a tabletop role-playing game set in a world inspired by the landscapes, creatures, and legends of Australia. Whether you’re trekking through the Outback, navigating the waterways of a crocodile-infested billabong, or trading stories at a smoky bush pub, adventure is never far away.

This is a game of cooperative storytelling, where you and your friends take on the roles of unique characters, facing challenges set by the Games Master (GM)—the one running the world, narrating the scenes, and keeping the story moving.

As you explore, you’ll meet strange and wonderful creatures, stumble into unexpected dangers, and have to think on your feet to survive. Your choices shape the story, and the dice determine whether things go to plan or take a turn for the worse.

## How the Game Works

Bunyips and Bandits is all about collaborative storytelling. Before you dive into adventure, you’ll create your own character with a unique background, skills, and motivations. They might be a cunning trickster, a brawny bushranger, or a sorcerer who accidentally sets things on fire more often than intended. Unlike a board game where you follow a strict set of rules, here, you step into the boots, paws, claws or webbed feet of the unique character you’ve created. Your choices shape how the story unfolds, and your character's actions drive the adventure.

The GM is the one pulling the strings—setting up the world, playing non-player characters (NPCs), and ensuring the game flows smoothly (or chaotically, depending on the players). The GM also acts as the ultimate referee, deciding how events play out based on a combination of logic, game rules, and a little bit of storytelling flair. The core of the game boils down to this:

1. The GM describes a scene.
2. You decide what your character does.
3. Dice rolls determine whether you pull it off spectacularly, fail hilariously, or land somewhere in between.
4. The story unfolds, shaped by your actions and decisions.

The game is intended to be fast and flexible, designed to keep the action moving rather than bogging you down with spreadsheets. The rules encourage creativity—if you want to try something ridiculous, the GM won’t stop you (although the outcome might not be favourable).

This handbook provides a solid framework, but the most important rule is that everyone at the table enjoys themselves. If something doesn’t quite fit your playstyle, tweak it. The game is meant to be adaptable, just like the creatures that roam its world.

## What You’ll Need

Your game setup depends on your style. If you love the feel of pencil on paper, all you need is a character sheet and some dice. If you prefer digital, check out the official website for an easy gameplay experience: _https://kyefelton.github.io/bunyips-and-bandits-app_ 

Dice are essential, whether physical or virtual. Bunyips and Bandits uses polyhedral dice sets, including d4, d6, d8, d12, and d20.

The GM may also want a board, physical or digital, to track character positions in combat, but if you're a fan of _Theatre of the Mind_, let your imagination do the work.

At the end of the day, all you _really_ need is a good group, a few dice, and a sense of adventure. Everything else? That’s just gravy.

## Characters

At the heart of Bunyips and Bandits are the characters you create and play. While the GM plays the role of everyone and everything else, you’ll be in control of one character—making their choices, speaking in their voice, and deciding how they handle the dangers (and opportunities) that come their way.

### Creating Your First Character

Before setting off on your first adventure, you’ll need to create a character. This involves a few simple steps:

1. **Choose a species**: You can play as one of many different creatures, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique traits. Your species affects your base stats, including health, movement, senses, size, armour, and skills.
2. **Describe your character**: Think about who they are beyond the numbers on the sheet. What’s their name? What do they look like? Where do they come from? Why have they taken to the adventuring life instead of settling down somewhere safe? The GM will work with you to weave your character into the world, ensuring they have a reason to be involved in the story.
3. **Select a level**: Your character’s level denotes the amount of experience they have, ranked from 1-20. As your character levels up, they become more skilful and powerful.
4. **Choose your paths**: Paths define a unique set of traits and actions that your character has acquired and mastered. At level 1, you can choose one path to start with. You’ll be able to progress this path or unlock new ones to develop your character’s abilities as you progress. 
5. **Upgrade your skills**: Every character has a set of skills that define their physical and mental abilities. At the start, you’ll have some default skills from your species, plus two skill upgrades to improve any abilities you like. As you level up, you’ll get even more opportunities to improve your character’s skills.
6. **Create a unique trait**: Every adventurer has something special about them—something that sets them apart. This is where you and the GM get creative. Your unique trait is linked to your backstory and gives your character an advantage in certain situations. For example, a former assassin might deal extra damage when attacking from behind.

### Species

Your species affects your character’s base stats and natural abilities. Some species are tougher, others are faster, and some have heightened senses that let them track a target through thick bushland. What you choose will influence how you experience the world, both in terms of game mechanics and role-playing opportunities.

### Levelling

As you adventure, your character gains experience and improves over time. Levelling up unlocks stronger abilities, better stats, and new paths. The most novice characters start at level 1 and can work their way up to level 20 by completing missions and surviving dangerous encounters. The GM decides when levelling up happens—usually after completing a major milestone. For balance, it’s recommended that all characters level up together so that no one gets left behind.

### Skills

Skills determine how well your character performs various actions. They include:

* **Strength**: used for physical manoeuvres requiring strength, such as breaking down a door, carrying a heavy load, or escaping a grapple
* **Agility**: used for physical manoeuvres requiring balance and quick reflexes, such as dodging an attack, running through a busy street, or recovering from a fall
* **Dexterity**: used for tasks requiring fine motor control and hand-eye coordination, such as pick pocketing, disabling a trap, or playing an instrument
* **Throw**: used for hurling objects with precision and distance
* **Intelligence**: used for tasks requiring mental acuity, such as investigating a scene, researching in a library, or recalling historical events
* **Nature**: used for wilderness and animal-related tasks, such as taming an animal, tracking, or navigating a forest
* **Willpower**: used for mental fortitude, such as resisting psychic attacks or countering attempts of intimidation
* **Charisma**: used for social interactions requiring influence, such as charming, persuading or deceiving others
* **Psychology**: used for assessing the behaviours and mannerisms of others to determine their true thoughts and emotions
* **Stealth**: used for avoiding detection, such as surprise ambushing or sneaking past another creature
* **Sight**: used for visual perception tasks, such as spotting hidden objects or seeing in the dark
* **Hearing**: used for auditory perception tasks, such as hearing faint noise or identifying specific sounds in a noisy environment
* **Smell**: used for olfactory perception tasks, such as detecting and tracking scents

Furthermore, the following skills can be unlocked and progressed when levelling up a path:

* **Martial**: used for armed melee attacks
* **Pyro**: used for fire sorcery, such as igniting a creature on fire
* **Electric**: used for electric sorcery, such as casting a lightning bolt
* **Kinetic**: used for kinetic sorcery, such as manifesting a gust of wind
* **Radiant**: used for light sorcery, such as camouflaging into your surroundings
* **Sonic**: used for sound sorcery, such as mimicking the voice of another creature
* **Psychic**: used for psionics, such as mind reading
* **Toxic**: used for producing poisons, venom and acids
* **Healing**: used for healing creatures
* **Spirit**: used for evocation, such as speaking to the dead

Skills range from level 1 to level 5, with higher levels granting better rolls and stronger effects. At level 1, you start with two skill upgrades, and as you progress, you gain more opportunities to refine your strengths.

### Paths

Paths define a set of learnings in a field of sorcery, morphing, psionics, evocation or martial arts. Consider them as specialisations that define what your character excels at. Each path unlocks new skills, actions, and passive traits that can give you the edge in combat or social encounters. You start with one path at level 1. At level 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20, you can progress an existing path or choose to learn a new one.

### Health

Your character isn’t invincible—adventuring comes with its fair share of scrapes, bruises, and mind-melting horrors. The game tracks three aspects of your character’s health:

* **Physique**: How much physical damage you can take before collapsing. If your physique hits zero, you’re incapacitated—meaning you can’t move, fight, or do much of anything until you recover.
* **Morale**: Your mental resilience, tested by terrifying encounters and psychic manipulation. Certain experiences—like witnessing the death of an ally horrific—can drain your morale. If your morale drops to zero, then you gain a mental condition that lasts until you recover some morale.
* **Stamina**: How much energy you have before exhaustion sets in. Stamina depletes as you perform actions with a stamina cost. If an action has a stamina cost, you need to have at least that much left in your stamina pool to perform it.

To determine what mental condition your character gains after losing all morale, roll a d6 and then take the matching condition from the list:

1. **Fainting**: You pass out for 10 minutes, then regain 1 morale.
2. **Delusions**: You experience constant hallucinations. You may mistake people for monsters, monsters for people or have flashbacks of past experiences.
3. **Hysteria**: Uncontrollable emotional outbursts—laughing, crying, screaming.
4. **Amnesia**: You forget who you are and why you’re here.
5. **Paranoia**: You’re overwhelmed with fear, easily startled and flee from all danger. You even have trouble trusting your friends.
6. **Hyperfocus**: You become obsessed with a single, pointless task, such as cleaning your boots, or going home to prepare for dinner tomorrow.

### Armour

Not all damage is equal—some creatures are resistant to certain types and vulnerable to others. There are five types of physical damage, and each creature has armour score for each:

* Fire
* Electric
* Toxic
* Slash
* Force

If you have a positive amour score, you reduce incoming damage of that type by your armour score. If your armour score is negative, you take extra damage equal to the value instead.

### Size

Not all creatures are built the same. Every character is assigned a size dependent on the species you chose. Certain actions, spells, or environmental hazards may affect characters differently based on their size. Sizes are categorised based on their approximate dimensions:

* **Tiny**: <0.5m
* **Small**: 0.5 - 1m
* **Medium**: 1-2m
* **Large**: 2-4m
* **Huge**: >4m

### Speed

Creatures in Bunyips and Bandits move in four ways: walking, climbing, swimming, and flying. Different species have access to different types of locomotion, each at its own speed. Your speed stat determines how far you can move per turn for each type of locomotion available to you.

### Senses

You can’t interact with what you can’t detect—your senses determine how well you perceive the world around you. There are eight primary senses:

* **Standard sight**: Ability to see the visible light spectrum.
* **Infrared sight**: Perception of heat radiated as infrared light.
* **Standard hearing**: Capacity to hear airborne sounds.
* **Tremor hearing**: Feeling vibrations in the ground or water
* **Smell**: Detection of airborne odours
* **Psychic sense**: Sensing the presence of psychic waves emitted from cognitive thinking

Different creatures are capable of different senses, and their level in the corresponding skill determines their adeptness in that sense. The environment also plays a role in determining how well the creature can perceive their surroundings. A dark cave makes things hard to see. A windy night messes with your ability to track scents. The GM decides how effective each sense is depending on the situation and the result of your skill check for that sense.

### Language

There are many different languages in the world of Bunyips and Bandits. If two creatures share a language, they can communicate normally. If they don’t, well… good luck. You might be relying on gestures, drawings, or elaborate games of charades. Some psychic abilities allow characters to understand and communicate regardless of language barriers. Otherwise, you might just have to make do with pointing and hoping for the best.

## Skill Checks

As you step into the game, the GM will present various scenarios and challenges along the way. Depending on your decisions and what the GM throws at you, you may need to make skill checks. Whether you’re trying to charm a merchant, track a beast, or break down a locked door, your character’s skill check determines how well they perform certain tasks.

### When to Roll

The GM decides when a skill check is needed. If something is challenging, risky, or uncertain, you’ll likely need to roll for it. For example, if you say:

* _“I walk across the room.”_ → No roll needed (unless the room is full of bear traps).
* _“I sprint across a crumbling rope bridge while dodging arrows.”_ → Definitely a roll.

### How Skill Checks Work

To perform a skill check, roll the die that corresponds to your skill level:

* Level 1: d4
* Level 2: d6
* Level 3: d8
* Level 4: d12
* Level 5: d20

If you have any bonuses or penalties, add (or subtract) them from your roll.

If you don't have a level for the required skill, then you take 1 as the result.

The GM sets a difficulty rating for the task:

* **Easy**: 2+
* **Moderate**: 4+
* **Hard**: 6+
* **Extreme**: 10+
* **Impossible**: 16+

If your roll meets or beats the target number, you succeed. If not, well… the GM will decide what happens next. (Hint: it probably won’t be good)

### Using the Right Skill

The skill you roll depends on how you approach the problem. For example:

* Want to intimidate someone? Roll Strength (if you’re flexing menacingly) or Charisma (if you’re going for a more persuasive threat).
* Trying to escape from quicksand? You might roll Agility (to wriggle free) or Strength (to brute-force your way out).
* Performing surgery? That might be Dexterity (for steady hands) and Intelligence (for knowing where organs go).

If in doubt, the GM decides which skill applies.

### Failing a Skill Check

Failure doesn’t always mean instant disaster—but it does mean things don’t go to plan. Instead of breaking down the door, maybe you hurt your shoulder. Instead of sneaking past the guards, maybe you step on a creaky floorboard.
Some failures are just bad luck. Others are… _really_ bad luck. That’s where the GM gets to have some fun.

## Luck

Sometimes, life doesn’t come down to skill—it comes down to sheer dumb luck.
Luck checks are used when:

* An outcome is completely random (e.g. does the abandoned shack have treasure or spiders? You’re running from an enemy and leap off a cliff—does a conveniently placed tree branch break your fall?).
* There’s no clear skill involved (e.g. flipping a coin, drawing a random card).

A luck check is a simple d20 roll. Higher rolls mean better outcomes, and lower rolls mean things go pear-shaped.

## Combat

Sometimes, words fail. And when they do, there’s always combat. Combat can be initiated by you or the GM at anytime. When a battle takes place, combat rules are applied.

Combat follows a structured turn-based system, but it’s designed to be quick and flexible—encouraging creativity rather than bogging you down in rules. The characters involved in the combat are placed on a gridded board, where each square roughly scales to 1.5m in width. The party that initiated the combat acts first, and then the opposing party goes next. Player turns go clockwise around the table, while the GM controls enemies on their turn. Each round represents about 5 seconds in the game world.

### Actions

On their turn, each character may perform as many actions as specified by the action count on their character sheet. Actions may incur damage, inflict statuses, or provide buffs.

Every character has a list of actions that they have mastered, and can unlock more as they progress their paths. You can perform the actions you’ve learnt on your turn, or you can get creative and try something different. For example, you could try burning a bridge before your opponent crosses, or lasso a charging creature with your rope. In that case, describe your action to the GM and make a skill check to see if you succeed on it. GM will decide the outcome of your action based on your description and skill check result.

Some actions cost stamina, while others are free. Be mindful—if you burn through all your stamina, you might find yourself too exhausted to fight when it really matters.

### Movement

Moving is an action available to all characters. The distance that a character can move in one turn is determined by their speed stat for the locomotion they use (i.e. walk, swim, climb or fly). Standard movement doesn’t use stamina, but the character can optionally expend stamina to increase the distance they move. Using one stamina will double the distance moved, using two stamina will triple the distance moved, and so on. They can expend a maximum of four stamina per movement action.

Some terrain slows movement (mud, dense bush), while others make it risky (unstable bridges, slippery surfaces). The GM will let you know if the ground under your feet is about to betray you.

### Range and area of effect

Some actions cover an area that can hit multiple targets. All actions have a target point - a location where the caster unleashes their energy. Area of effect describe the size and shape of the area affected by the action:

* **Single target**: The action only affects one creature or object.
* **Multiple targets**: The action can affect as many creatures or objects in range, as chosen by the caster.
* **Cone**: A cone extends in a direction from its target point. The caster chooses a length and width of up to 5m.
* **Sphere**: A sphere extends from the target point, with a radius chosen by the caster up to 3m.
* **Arena**: The action affects all locations in the combat arena.

Each action also has a range, which determines how far the target point can be located:

* **Self**: the caster is the target point.
* **Adjacent**: the caster or a square adjacent to the spell caster is the target point.
* **Nearby**: the spell caster can be positioned anywhere within 10m and the perception of the caster.
* **Distant**: the target point can be positioned anywhere within the perception of the caster.

Obstructions can block attacks—if a wall, tree, or sturdy shield is in the way, the GM may rule that your action doesn’t hit as expected.

Hidden enemies can’t be directly targeted, but they can be hit by area of effects if you’re lucky enough to guess their location.**

### Hitting a target

Landing an attack isn’t always guaranteed—opponents can counter, dodge or resist attacks:

* **Counter**: The defender rolls the same skill check as the attacker to counter the attack. If the action uses a throw skill, then the defender rolls a kinetic check instead to deflect it.
* **Dodge**: If the attack is physical and doesn’t cover a large area, the defender can roll an agility check to dodge it.
* **Resist**: If it is a psychic attack, the defender can roll a willpower check to resist the effect.

If the attacker rolls higher than the defender, the attack hits and the defender takes the effect of the action. If the defender rolls equal to or higher, they avoid the attack.

Every character has an evasions count on their character sheet. The evasions count determines the number of attacks they can attempt to evade in one round of combat.

### Statuses

Some actions inflict statuses upon their foes. All statuses, except for burning, last only one round. Some of the :

* **Stunned**: The character loses an evasion until their next turn. If they have no evasions, then they lose an action on their next turn. This status can be stacked multiple times in a round.
* **Empowered**: The character gains an evasion until their next turn. This status can be stacked multiple times in a round.
* **Protected**: The character armour increases by the specified amount for the specified damage type until their next turn. This status can be stacked multiple times in a round.
* **Restrained**: The character cannot dodge attacks or move to a new position until the end of their next turn.
* **Burning**: The character takes 1d8 fire damage at the start of each their turns. After taking the damage, the creature may use an action to douse the flame and remove the status.
* **Invisible**: The character cannot be detected through sight or infrared sight until their next turn.
* **Silent**: The character cannot be detected through hearing or tremor hearing until their next turn.
* **Odourless**: The character cannot be detected through smell until their next turn.
* **Composed**: The character cannot be detected by psychic sense until the end of their next turn.
* **Blinded**: The character cannot see visible or infrared light until the end of their next turn.
* **Deafened**: The character cannot hear sounds in the air or tremors in the earth or water until the end of their next turn.
* **Anosmic**: The character cannot smell until the end of their next turn.
* **Blocked**: The character cannot psychic sense until the end of their next turn.
* **Disoriented**: The character is blind, deaf and anosmic.
* **Deluded**: The caster controls the perception of the target to make them see, hear or smell an altered reality.
* **Hypnotised**: The target cannot harm the caster. They must obey any commands and act with the best interest of the caster. If the target is attacked by anyone from the opposing side, this status is removed.
* **Frightened**: The creature is immobilised with fear and their turn is skipped.
* **Madness**: The creature can only attack the closest creature near them.
* **Provoked**: The creature must use at least one of their actions to attempt to harm the caster.

### Resolving Combat

When a character loses all of their health or morale, they are out of the combat. Once all characters in the same party have been defeated or surrender, they lose the combat. The victorious party chooses whether to kill, capture or leave the losers in their place. If the players lose the combat, it’s up to the GM to decide their fate.

At any point during their turn, a character can attempt to flee. It is up to the GM discretion to determine whether a character has successfully fled the combat. If successful, then the character is out of the combat and their fate isn’t determined by their opponents.
