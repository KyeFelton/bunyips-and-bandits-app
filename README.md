# Bunyips and Bandits Character App

This project is in active development.

This project is written in Typescript React to demonstrate my understanding of the framework. I'll use shadcn for speedy development.

The next project, Bunyips and Bandits Wiki, will be written in svelte to demonstrate my capability to learn a new framework. I'll use css styling to demonstrate my competency in this area. Svelte tutorial here: <https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte>
